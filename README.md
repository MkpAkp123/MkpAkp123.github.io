## Cool Websites :)
### Here are 2 of my favorite websites:
#### **1. [_The New York Times Games_](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords)**
> I find these games really enjoyable, and I like comparing scores with my friends.  **_Connections_** is my favorite game, where the objecctive is to find common traits among words.  **_Wordle_** is a close second, fun to do with friends.  It's a game where you have to try to guess a five letter word in six tries or less.  **_Wordle_** is also incredibly popular among my classmates in school, so it can be fun to compete to see who can solve for the word with the least amount of guesses.

#### **2. [_GeoGeussr_](https://www.geoguessr.com/)**
>**_GeoGeussr_** is a game where you are given an image of a random place on Earth, and you have to try to pinpoint it as best as you can. It's a game that really tests how much you know about different regions of the world, and really shifts your perspective of things. I have one friend who can recognizes places just by the type of trees or grasses. It's crazy what some of the people that play this game could accomplish with their skills.
